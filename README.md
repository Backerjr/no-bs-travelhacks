## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this website is to cut through the noise of "genius" travel hacks that don't actually work. We focus on practical, repeatable advice that saves you money, time, and stress.

-   **No Gimmicks:** Just strategies that are proven to work.
-   **Simple & Clean:** A straightforward website that is fast and easy to use.
-   **Community Driven:** (Future Goal) A place to share and discuss real travel hacks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This is a simple static website built with fundamental web technologies, making it fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.

## üìù Notes for Myself

-   **Deployment:** The site is hosted on GitHub Pages from the `main` branch and `/(root)` folder. The `.nojekyll` file is required to prevent GitHub from using the Jekyll build process.
-   **Chatbot API:** The chatbot script in `index.html` needs its `apiHost` updated with the public URL once the Flowise server is deployed.
-   **Design:** Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts (`Inter` and `Lato`). The hero image is from Unsplash.
